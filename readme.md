## Dataset

> The Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) is a worldwide study developed by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) which examines the skills of 15-year-old school students around the world. The study assesses students' mathematics, science, and reading skills and contains a wealth of information on students' background, their school and the organization of education systems. For most countries, the sample is around 5,000 students, but in some countries the number is even higher. In total, the PISA 2012 dataset contains data on 485 490 pupils.


## Summary of Findings

> female students have better grades, Although Female and Male students have the same average grade and range<br>
**Mexico** has the highest student with `7.2%` followed by **Italy** with `6.3%` which is much higher than the average (1.54%)<br>
Interestingly while male students owns more home possessions by 0.3, Female students have more home educational resources by 0.3,This can be explained by parents reluctance to spend on female's home possessions and instead choose to finance more educational resources.<br>
While both female and male students have equal grade mean in science, Female students score higher grades in reading and Male students score higher in math<br>
grade distribution is almost the same in all countries except for Brazil has the highest grades<br>
strong positive correlation and huge impact of wealth,  home possessions and home resources on Math, Science and Reading grades.<br>
Unexpectedly use if ICT at school is negatively correlated with Math, Science and reading grades.<br>
There is a very strong correlation between grades of all 3 subjects.<br>
Study time for math and reading has very low correlation with grades.<br>
Strong correlation among all school factors suggest co-existence in schools environment.<br>
Student attitude toward School have high influence in average students grade, specially Students' sense of belonging toward schools.
This shows the importance of school environment in students' moral and grades<br>
What a surprise! Use of ICT "Information and Communications Technology" in school has inverse relation with grades<br>
Strict Disciplinary climate and good relation between teachers and students positively affect students grade<br>
Math Teacher support and Cognitive activation in math lessons both positively affect students grade.<br>
It looks like math classroom management is centered but with slight negative correlation, Students need more freedom in asking questions and requesting elaboration. <br>
